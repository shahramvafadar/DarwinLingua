Darwin Lingua is a modular language-learning platform built with `.NET 10` and `.NET MAUI`.

The first learner-facing product is **Darwin Deutsch**, a German-learning application focused on practical vocabulary and real-life language support for immigrants, newcomers, foreign workers, and other serious learners.

## Current Status

The repository is currently **in active Phase 1 implementation**, not feature-complete.

- the product direction, domain, storage, offline, and import strategy are documented
- the solution structure exists under `src/`
- the MAUI app now has migration-based local SQLite startup initialization, compatibility baselining for older local `EnsureCreated` databases, UI localization, persisted local learning-profile preferences, CEFR browsing, topic browsing, indexed German lemma search with prefix-first ranking, word details, favorites, settings-based language selection, and platform TTS actions for German words and example sentences with graceful localized failure handling
- the startup infrastructure now exposes explicit `InitializeDatabase` and `SeedReferenceData` use-case workflows (while preserving one-call startup initialization)
- the catalog module now contains the first real lexical aggregate model for words, senses, translations, examples, topic links, browse/search queries, and detail-query foundations
- the learning module now persists local favorite words and lightweight user word state separately from catalog content, including favorite toggle/list workflows, view tracking, and known/difficult markers with clear actions
- the import tool can bootstrap the shared local database, apply reference seeds, import canonical JSON content packages, skip duplicates conservatively, reject repeated `packageId` values, and return an operator-facing summary
- SQLite-backed integration tests now cover reference-data seeding presence and idempotency for Phase 1 language/topic seed workflows
- localization coverage checks now enforce English/German `AppStrings` resource-key parity in automated tests
- infrastructure mapping tests now verify key EF Core uniqueness/index constraints for Phase 1 persistence entities
- import workflow tests now cover mixed valid/invalid entries and duplicate-entry skipping behavior within a package
- practical smoke tests now guard the MAUI startup path to ensure DB initialization and localization initialization remain wired
- important Phase 1 workflows such as broader UI/UX foundation work and release hardening are still not implemented yet

The current import contract maps one imported entry to one imported sense with meanings and examples.

The next high-priority slices are UI/UX foundation work and release hardening based on the backlog.

## Product Direction

Darwin Lingua is designed as a multi-product platform, not as a one-off single-language app.

Current product:

- Darwin Deutsch

Possible future products:

- Darwin English
- Darwin Arabic
- Darwin Turkish
- Darwin Persian

Phase 1 remains intentionally focused on a local-first, vocabulary-first German product.

## Phase 1 Focus

### Included

- CEFR-based browsing
- topic-based browsing
- German lemma search
- multilingual meanings
- example sentences
- one or two selected meaning languages
- favorites
- lightweight user word state
- platform text-to-speech
- SQLite local storage
- JSON-based content import
- offline-capable core experience
- English and German UI localization

### Deferred

- spaced repetition
- quiz/review engine
- grammar engine
- collocations and lexical relations
- cloud sync
- web application
- public Web API
- admin editing workflows
- support-resource directory
- import merge/update behavior

## Architecture

The intended architecture is:

- modular monolith
- clean architecture
- bounded contexts
- shared business core
- local-first Phase 1 delivery

Active Phase 1 contexts:

- `Catalog`
- `Learning`
- `ContentOps`
- `Localization`

Deferred but designed:

- `Practice`
- `Resource Discovery`

## Storage Direction

For the Phase 1 MAUI product, `SQLite` is the correct primary database.

If later web/API/admin/server-side workloads require a stronger shared backend database, `PostgreSQL` is the preferred default direction for that server-side part of the platform.

## Engineering Standards

The project has explicit implementation standards in:

- [Engineering Standards](docs/35-Engineering-Standards.md)

Important rules include:

- null handling is mandatory
- code should be production quality, not throwaway prototype code
- classes, methods, and important logic blocks require English comments
- all user-facing strings must come from localization resources
- the UI must support English and German from day one
- the default UI language should follow the device language where supported
- the user must be able to override UI language in settings
- UI/UX quality is a core requirement, not a polish-only concern

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

- `.NET 10 SDK`
- `.NET MAUI` workloads
- Visual Studio version with `.slnx` and MAUI support

Optional developer tooling:

- `dotnet tool restore` for local EF Core migration commands

Common local migration commands:

```text
dotnet tool restore
dotnet tool run dotnet-ef migrations add <MigrationName> --project src/BuildingBlocks/DarwinLingua.Infrastructure --context DarwinLinguaDbContext --output-dir Persistence/Migrations
```

Open:

```text
DarwinLingua.slnx
```

## Working Rule

Implementation should follow the backlog:

- [Implementation Backlog](docs/04-Implementation-Backlog.md)

That file is the execution checklist for Phase 1 and should be updated as work progresses.
