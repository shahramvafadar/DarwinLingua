# Continuation Handoff (Codex / Chat Reset)

## Purpose

This document captures the **minimum context needed to continue implementation in a new chat** without losing execution state.

Use it when:

- the active coding chat becomes too long
- tooling context is truncated
- you need to hand work to a new agent run

---

## Current Snapshot (as of 2026-03-27)

- Phase 1 is still in progress.
- Core app flows exist: home, CEFR browse, topic browse, search, word details, favorites, settings.
- Home now includes dashboard quick actions for search, topic browse, and favorites in addition to CEFR shortcuts.
- The browse tab now acts as a real browse hub with CEFR shortcuts, topic browsing, and direct paths to search and favorites.
- Catalog domain hardening is complete for Phase 1 aggregate invariants, uniqueness constraints, and topic-link relationship constraints.
- Learning-domain separation is now enforced at the persistence boundary: local user-state rows stay decoupled from catalog-content foreign keys and survive content-row deletion.
- Current MAUI user-facing labels and lexical metadata text are now routed through `AppStrings` resource catalogs for both English and German.
- Shared MAUI reusable controls currently include:
  - `WordListItemView`
  - `TopicListItemView`
  - `DetailSectionView`
  - `CefrQuickFilterView`
  - `ActionBlockView`
- Database initialization, seed workflows, localization setup, and transactional write service are implemented.
- Full local Windows checks now succeed: `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, and `dotnet test` on `DarwinLingua.slnx`.
- On Windows, prefer `dotnet test DarwinLingua.slnx -c Debug --no-restore -m:1` to avoid transient MAUI Android file-lock failures inside `obj\Debug\net10.0-android`.
- Phase 1 release validation now has a dedicated checklist in `docs/43-Phase-1-Release-Checklist.md`.
- Manual device validation now has a dedicated worksheet in `docs/44-Phase-1-Manual-Validation-Worksheet.md`.
- Release sign-off and accepted-known-issues capture now have a template in `docs/45-Phase-1-Release-Notes-Template.md`.
- Windows release-prep automation now has a dedicated script in `tools/Phase1/Invoke-Phase1ReleasePrep.ps1` to capture restore/build/test evidence and prefill release metadata.
- Phase 1 release execution now also has a wrapper in `tools/Phase1/Start-Phase1ReleaseValidation.ps1` that creates a per-run validation bundle with the automated summary, a worksheet copy, and a release-notes draft.
- Automated release-readiness coverage now includes clean-install database initialization validation and sample content-package import validation.
- Automated release-readiness coverage now also validates import and browse/search responsiveness on a realistic starter dataset size.
- MAUI smoke coverage now also guards localized shell/page wiring and ensures core learner flows stay free of direct network dependencies.
- The canonical Phase 1 project/reference structure is now locked to the current modular-monolith layout documented in `docs/31-Solution-Architecture.md`.
- Starter localization reference data now seeds meaning-language support for `en`, `fa`, `ru`, `ar`, `pl`, `tr`, `ro`, `sq`, `ckb`, and `kmr`, with `en`/`de` still serving as the initial UI-language pair.
- The canonical Phase 1 sample content package now contains twelve German seed words across CEFR `A1`-`C2`, each carrying meanings in the seeded starter language set.
- Phase 2 now includes the new `Practice` bounded context, `GetPracticeOverview`, a due-aware deterministic `GetReviewQueue`, `StartReviewSession`, `GetRecentActivity`, `GetLearningProgressSnapshot`, `SubmitFlashcardAnswer`, and `SubmitQuizAnswer` with persisted attempt history and spaced-repetition scheduling updates.
- The MAUI app now exposes a localized `Practice` tab and home-screen entry point, plus a real practice overview screen with progress metrics, review-session preview, and recent activity backed by the Practice application services.
- The Practice UI now supports end-to-end flashcard and quiz sessions, including answer reveal, answer submission, per-answer feedback, and a session summary state, all localized through `AppStrings`.
- Practice now also has a dedicated `DarwinLingua.Practice.Application.Tests` project that covers review-queue/session delegation and quiz-answer submission behavior at the application-service layer.
- Practice infrastructure coverage now also includes query/persistence behavior for missing meanings and inactive content filtering, plus a release-readiness performance test over a realistic early-learning practice dataset.
- Manual/device-bound Practice validation now has a dedicated worksheet in `docs/46-Phase-2-Practice-Validation-Worksheet.md`.
- Phase 3 mobile lexical-intelligence slices now include imported usage/context labels, learner-facing grammar notes, collocations, word families, and synonym/antonym relations on `WordEntry`, all flowing through `GetWordDetails` into the upgraded word-detail screen, plus broader visual-consistency polish across the main learner-facing mobile screens.
- Manual/device-bound Phase 3 mobile UX validation now has a dedicated worksheet in `docs/47-Phase-3-Mobile-UX-Validation-Worksheet.md`.
- A single mobile validation bundle can now be prepared with `tools/Mobile/Start-MobileValidationBundle.ps1`, using the runbook in `docs/48-Mobile-Validation-Bundle-Runbook.md`.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs restore/build/test on non-MAUI projects and test projects.

## Recommended Next Implementation Slice

Focus next on the remaining Phase 2 practice quality and release-readiness items while keeping the remaining Phase 1 manual release checks visible.

Suggested scope:

1. Validate Phase 2 practice flows on target devices using `docs/46-Phase-2-Practice-Validation-Worksheet.md`.
2. Prepare one bundle with `tools/Mobile/Start-MobileValidationBundle.ps1`, execute the copied Phase 1/2/3 worksheets on target devices, and close the remaining mobile validation gates.
3. Keep the remaining manual device worksheet items for offline behavior, English UI, German UI, and TTS queued for final Phase 1 sign-off, then extend that validation to Practice flows.

## New Chat Prompt Template

Use the following prompt to resume implementation in a fresh chat:

```text
Continue DarwinLingua implementation from the latest commit.

Context:
- Read and follow docs/04-Implementation-Backlog.md and docs/42-Continuation-Handoff.md first.
- Phase 1 and Phase 2 only have manual device-bound validation left from my side.
- Prioritize execution of the bundled mobile worksheets prepared via `tools/Mobile/Start-MobileValidationBundle.ps1` after the implemented usage/context labels, grammar notes, collocations, word families, lexical relations, and broader learner-facing UI polish.
- Keep all user-facing text localized via AppStrings resources for any newly added UI.
- After code changes, update backlog/docs status accurately.
- Run the full local Windows .NET checks after changes.

Delivery requirements:
- Make focused, production-quality changes.
- Run available checks.
- Commit changes.
- Provide a concise summary with exact file references and next step suggestions.
```
