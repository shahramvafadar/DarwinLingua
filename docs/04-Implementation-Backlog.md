# Implementation Backlog

## Purpose

This document is the working implementation backlog for the repository.

It is intended to:

- show what is done and what is still pending
- define the Phase 1 implementation order
- keep the next execution steps explicit
- provide high-level placeholders for later phases

This backlog should be updated continuously during implementation.

---

## Status Tracking Rule

Use these markers consistently:

- `[ ]` not started
- `[-]` in progress
- `[x]` completed
- `[!]` blocked / needs decision

Do not delete completed items. Mark them as completed so progress remains visible.

---

## Phase 1 Target Outcome

Phase 1 is complete when the repository contains a usable local-first MAUI app and a working import pipeline that together support:

- database initialization
- reference data seeding
- content package import
- CEFR browsing
- topic browsing
- German lemma search
- word details
- English and German UI
- user-selectable UI language
- favorite words
- lightweight user word state
- platform text-to-speech

Planned areas:

- support resources
- category and location search
- saved useful resources
- admin-managed resource updates

---

## Phase 5 Backlog Placeholder

Phase 5 focuses on server-backed platform expansion.

Planned areas:

- Web API

## Backlog Maintenance Rule

Before starting a new implementation slice:

- move the selected items to `[-]`
- keep unrelated items unchanged
- mark completed work with `[x]`
- add any newly discovered tasks in the correct workstream

This file should remain the main execution checklist for the project.
