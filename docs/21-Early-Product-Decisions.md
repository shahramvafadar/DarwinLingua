# Early Product Decisions

## Purpose

This document records the early decisions that should be treated as active project direction unless they are replaced intentionally.

---

## Decision 1 - Official Import Format

The official Phase 1 import format is JSON.

---

## Decision 2 - Content Workflow

Content may be authored manually, generated with AI assistance, or produced through a hybrid workflow, but imported content must always conform to the approved package format.

---

## Decision 3 - Duplicate Import Behavior

Phase 1 import must skip duplicates and continue, while reporting the outcome clearly.

---

## Decision 4 - Controlled Growth

The product will grow in phases. Phase 1 must stay focused on a strong vocabulary-first release instead of trying to implement the full ecosystem immediately.

---

## Decision 5 - Architectural Style

The solution should begin as a clean modular monolith with disciplined internal boundaries.

---

## Decision 6 - Shared Core

The solution must be designed from the beginning for shared business logic across MAUI and future web/API/admin applications.

---

## Decision 7 - UI Localization From Day One

The application UI must be localizable from the start. Localization is not a later enhancement.

---

## Decision 8 - Initial UI Languages

The first UI languages are:

- English
- German

Additional UI languages may be introduced later.

---

## Decision 9 - UI Language Selection Behavior

The app should use the device language by default where supported, but the user must be able to change the UI language in settings.

---

## Decision 10 - User-Facing Strings

All user-facing strings must come from localization resources rather than hard-coded screen text.

---

## Decision 11 - Phase 1 Storage Choice

For the local-first MAUI application in Phase 1, SQLite is the primary storage choice.

---

## Decision 12 - Future Server Database Direction

If a future web/API/admin/backend part of the platform needs a stronger shared server database, PostgreSQL is the preferred default candidate unless a concrete requirement justifies another option.

---

## Decision 13 - Import Host Separation

The import workflow should be hosted separately from the learner-facing MAUI app, even if both reuse the same application core.

---

## Decision 14 - Engineering Quality Bar

Phase 1 code is not throwaway code. It must be written to production quality standards, including null-safety, localization discipline, testability, and documentation comments in English.
