# Domain Model

## Purpose

This document defines the domain model for the Darwin Deutsch platform.

The goal is to design the domain early and thoroughly enough so that:

- the vocabulary learning core is stable
- future modules can be added without architectural damage
- data import remains predictable
- web, mobile, admin, and API layers can share the same core model
- future practice, progress, and migrant-support modules can be added cleanly

This document intentionally focuses on the domain and data model, not UI design.

---

# 1. Domain Design Principles

## 1.1 Main Principles

The domain should follow these principles:

- clear separation of bounded contexts
- stable aggregate roots
- controlled vocabulary for metadata
- localization-aware design
- support for future extensibility
- support for AI-assisted content generation and import
- support for optional offline-first usage
- avoid overloading a single entity with unrelated concerns

## 1.2 Domain Shape

The product domain is not a single flat vocabulary table.

It is composed of several conceptual areas:

- Content Catalog
- Learning Content Structure
- Localization
- User Learning Data
- Practice and Review
- Resource Discovery
- Import and Content Operations

The first production phase will mostly use the Content Catalog and part of the User Learning Data.

---

# 2. High-Level Bounded Contexts

The domain should be split into the following bounded contexts.

## 2.1 Content Context

Responsible for:

- words
- meanings
- examples
- levels
- topics
- tags
- lexical metadata
- audio metadata
- content packages

This is the primary context for phase 1.

## 2.2 Learning Context

Responsible for:

- user favorites
- user study history
- known/unknown markers
- lightweight progress
- learning preferences

Used partly in phase 1 and more in later phases.

## 2.3 Practice Context

Responsible for:

- flashcards
- quizzes
- review queues
- spaced repetition
- mistake tracking
- practice sessions

Mainly phase 2.

## 2.4 Resource Discovery Context

Responsible for:

- useful places
- service providers
- support centers
- resource categories
- city/location links
- migrant-support information

Mainly phase 4.

## 2.5 Content Operations Context

Responsible for:

- import packages
- import jobs
- duplicate detection results
- validation reports
- content source tracking

This may exist as a domain-supporting context or application-supporting context depending on implementation strategy.

---

# 3. Domain Language

## 3.1 Core Terms

### Word
A German lexical entry shown to the learner.

### Sense
A distinct meaning or semantic usage of a word.

### Meaning Translation
A translation of a sense into another language.

### Example Sentence
A German sentence showing usage of a word or sense.

### Example Translation
A translation of the example sentence into another language.

### Topic
A controlled thematic grouping such as travel or doctor.

### CEFR Level
A level such as A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, or C2.

### Usage Label
A label such as formal, informal, spoken, written, business, or daily-life.

### Context Label
A real-life usage context such as doctor, office, transport, or housing.

### Content Package
A batch of content prepared for import.

### Resource
A helpful place, organization, or support entry for users.

---

# 4. Enumerations and Controlled Values

The domain should avoid uncontrolled text wherever stability matters.

---

## 4.1 CEFR Level

Allowed values:

- A1
- A2
- B1
- B2
- C1
- C2

---

## 4.2 Part of Speech

Recommended initial values:

- Noun
- Verb
- Adjective
- Adverb
- Pronoun
- Preposition
- Conjunction
- Interjection
- Numeral
- Phrase
- Expression
- Other

---

## 4.3 Usage Register

Recommended values:

- Formal
- Informal
- Spoken
- Written
- Everyday
- Business
- Academic
- Official

- Impolite
- Sensitive

Not all are needed in phase 1, but the model should support them.

---

## 4.4 Audio Kind

Recommended values:

- WordPronunciation
- ExamplePronunciation
- SlowPronunciation
- HumanRecorded
- Synthetic

---

## 4.5 Import Source Type

Recommended values:

- Manual

---

## 4.6 Publication Status

Recommended values:

- Draft
- Active
- Archived
- Deprecated

Useful for future content workflow even if phase 1 keeps everything active.

---

# 5. Core Content Domain

This is the most important section.

The content model must be rich enough for future growth but not chaotic.

---

## 5.1 Aggregate Root: WordEntry

Represents a core German lexical entry.

### Responsibilities

- identify the base German word
- hold stable lexical metadata
- hold one or more senses

# 11. Localization Domain Support

Localization should not be hacked into the UI only.

---

## 11.1 UI Localization

UI resource files may live outside the domain, but the domain should still recognize supported languages.

For domain-controlled localizable data, translation tables should exist where needed.

## 11.2 Localizable Domain Data

The following should support localization through domain entities or translation tables:

- Topic
- UsageLabel
- ContextLabel
- SupportResourceCategory
- future descriptive content

---

# 12. Identity and User Boundary

The domain should not tightly couple itself to a specific identity provider.

Use a stable `UserId` reference in learning and practice entities.

### Recommended Rule

The learning domain references users by external identity ID only, without embedding authentication logic into domain entities.

---

# 13. Auditing and Concurrency

Because content will evolve and may be edited/imported multiple times, the domain should consistently support:

- CreatedAtUtc
- UpdatedAtUtc
- CreatedBy where useful
- LastModifiedBy where useful
- RowVersion where useful

Not every table needs every field, but aggregate roots and important mutable entities should support concurrency.

---

# 14. Soft Delete vs Archive

For this product, soft delete should be used carefully.

### Recommended Rule

For learning content, prefer:

- PublicationStatus
- Active/Archived/Deprecated

instead of physical or logical delete in most cases.

Why:
- imported content may be referenced later
- user history may point to content
- auditability matters

For purely technical import logs, normal deletion policies may be acceptable.

---

# 15. Search Model Considerations

Search will be important from phase 1.

The content domain should support fields such as:

- NormalizedLemma
- SearchLemma
- NormalizedGermanText for examples
- topic keys

### Suggested Search Targets

- German word
- meanings in selected languages
- topics
- possibly example texts in later phases

This does not require a separate search engine in phase 1, but the model should support later expansion.

---

# 16. Recommended Aggregate Summary

## Content Context Aggregates

- WordEntry
- Topic
- UsageLabel
- ContextLabel
- Language
- ContentPackage

## Learning Context Aggregates

- UserLearningProfile
- LearningList

## Practice Context Aggregates

- ReviewQueueItem
- PracticeSession

## Resource Context Aggregates

- SupportResource
- SupportResourceCategory

---

# 17. Minimum Viable Domain for Phase 1

Even though the full model is broader, the actual first implementation can start with this smaller set:

- WordEntry
- WordSense
- SenseTranslation
- ExampleSentence
- ExampleTranslation
- Topic
- TopicLocalization
- WordTopic
- Language
- UserLearningProfile
- UserFavoriteWord
- UserWordState
- ContentPackage
- ContentPackageEntry

This is the minimum serious baseline.

---

# 18. Expanded Domain Candidate Set

If you want to design broadly from the start, these are the most likely long-term entities:

- WordEntry
- WordSense
- SenseTranslation
- ExampleSentence
- ExampleTranslation
- Topic
- TopicLocalization
- WordTopic
- UsageLabel
- UsageLabelLocalization
- WordSenseUsageLabel
- ContextLabel
- ContextLabelLocalization
- WordSenseContextLabel
- AudioAsset
- Language
- WordRelation
- Collocation
- CollocationTranslation
- GrammarHint
- ContentPackage
- ContentPackageEntry
- ImportJob
- UserLearningProfile
- UserFavoriteWord
- UserWordState
- UserRecentWord
- LearningList
- LearningListItem
- ReviewQueueItem
- PracticeSession
- PracticeSessionItem
- UserMistakePattern
- SupportResource
- SupportResourceCategory
- SupportResourceCategoryLocalization
- SupportResourceCategoryLink
- Address
- SupportResourceAddress
- SupportResourceTag

---

# 19. Design Warnings

## Warning 1

Do not collapse all meanings into a single text field on WordEntry.
That will break future extensibility.

## Warning 2

Do not store topic display names as random free text everywhere.
Use stable topic keys and localizations.

## Warning 3

Do not bind content structure directly to MAUI view models.
The domain must remain UI-independent.

## Warning 4

Do not design import around only the first 100 words.
Assume long-term growth from the beginning.

## Warning 5

Do not mix user progress data into the core content entities.
Keep user-specific state separate.

---

# 20. Recommended Next Steps
